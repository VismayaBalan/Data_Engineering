SELECT * FROM c

-- c is an alias for the document within a container
-- Filter documents from 
SELECT * FROM c where c.balance > 7000

-- Limit : Show top 10 records
SELECT TOP 10 * FROM c

-- Aggregate Operations
-- gives total count
SELECT VALUE COUNT(1) FROM c

-- Count with alias
SELECT COUNT(1) AS total_count FROM c

-- sum
SELECT VALUE sum(c.balance) FROM c
SELECT sum(c.balance) AS total_balance FROM c

-- AVG
SELECT VALUE AVG(c.balance) FROM c
SELECT AVG(c.balance) AS Avg_balance FROM c

-- Group By
SELECT c.job, AVG(c.balance) AS Avg_balance FROM c GROUP BY c.job

-- Order By
It does not works with aggregate operations

-- Distinct
select distinct c.job from c
